        <p>The whippet was popular in Lancashire and Yorkshire, probably during the late 1700s, so it is a modern breed,
            they were bred by crossing Greyhound with fast, long-legged terriers. This made them small and swift and
            used to hunt rabbits and other small game.</p>
        <p>The word whippet was used to describe any quick moving little dog, however it was only in the late nineteenth
            century that the Whippet were recognized as a separate breed.
            Whippets became first recognized in England, with racing in the mining areas and until the First World War
            this sport was more popular than greyhound racing.</p>
        <p>Whippets were bred to race, hunt and course, so enough daily exercise is important, however they love to be
            able to sleep on the sofa or a bed for most of the day.
            They had a tendency to snap up nearby prey, so they earned the name “snap dogs”.</p>
