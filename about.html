        <p>Please do your own research into a whippet is the right breed for you. However here are some pros and cons
            about whippets.</p>
        <p>Here are the Pro of owning a whippets:<br>
            They are very easy to maintain in the way of bathing and grooming, you really don't need to bath a whippet,
            the fur keeps itself clean natually, however the only time they should be bathed is when they roll in fox
            poo.<br>
            When they roll in fox poo you need some special shampoo to clean them with, because a normal dog shampoo
            will not get rid of the smell of fox poo.<br></p>
        <p> They love human company, and I also found that they also seem to like to live with at least one other
            whippet, however some whippets seem to be ok to be the only one in the household.<br>
            They spend a lot of time sleeping and they like to be covered up or you might find that they have crawel
            under your quilt cover</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here are some Cons of owning a whippets:</p>
        <p> Whippet are hunting dogs so they will chase cats if they was not on a lead. Also you will need a garden that
            they can't escape from but also keep in mind that whippets can also jump very high too.</p>
        <p>They cannot live outside in a kennel because of there short hair. In winter or wet weather they will need a
            winter coat which will keep them dry and warm, however they really don't like going for a walk in the rain.
        </p>
        <p>They can have good recall until something gets there attention, like a squirrels, rabbits or cats then they
            seem to turn there ears off to recall and will go and chase and possible kill example a squirrel.</p>

        <P>Whippets tend to have less health issues then other breeds, the avarage life span is between 12 - 15 years
            old, however they can live even longer.<br>
            <br>
            These are just some possible health issues:
        <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <!--unordered list and used text align left -->
            <li>heart murmur, this is a unusual sound that the heart makes.</li>
            <li>cryptorchidic or cryptorchidism, all this means is that one or both testicles have not decended.</li>
            <li>corns on the feet.</li>
            <li>Pancreatitis, this means that the pancreas is inflamed, which causes pain and vomiting.</li>
        </ul>
        </P>
        <p>In this short list I have picked the more common health issues that could possible occur, however this
            doesn't mean it will happen, especially if you do your research into kennel club breeders.<br>
            Whippets have very delicate skin which means that they can injury themselves very easlier.</p>
